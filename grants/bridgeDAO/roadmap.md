# BridgeDAO Roadmap

## Roadmap
Roadmap is divided in 3 phases, each 3 months long.  
Period and deliverable:  
Sep-Nov: *Documentation*  
Dec-Feb: *Proof of Concept*  
Mar-May: *Alpha*  

### Phase 1: Research
Period: September - November
*Description:*
In this phase we will conduct key research into how could this system work, what limitation are there, what are prerequisites of DAOs and other users, which partnerships to form, how to create a robust and durable incentive system, etc. Result of this phase will be a documentation which will describe the system in details and will be used for building the proof of concept, but also as a guide for further development.

*Deliverables:*
* Technical documentation
* Economics documentation
* Legal documentation

*Costs:*
* core team salaries
* compensation to advisors and reviewers
* travel (attend key events, meet key partners)


### Phase 2: Proof of Concept
Period: December - February
*Description:*
Simplest implementation of the system, a demo network of 5-10 nodes executing this successfully (it would be fairly manual, but still usable), will be built to serve as a proof of the concept. Also, a legal entity will be formed to manage the rights and funding for further development of the system. First partnerships will be formed to conduct tests. First tests will be done.

*Deliverables:*
* v0,2: System Link
Success criteria: built and tested Consumer, Watcher, Ping PoC
* v0,3 User Link
Success criteria: built and tested Ramp and Whisperbook PoC

*Costs:*
* core team salaries
* compensation to advisors, reviewers, testers
* travel (attend key events, meet key partners)

### Phase 3: Paperclip Alpha
Period: March - May
*Description:*
This phase will result in an extended network and a base layer of software available to nodes. We will build a suite of analytics and API-using software (which is generic enough to apply to most popular net-banking APIs and comes with popular bank support out of the box) to offer people so they can get started within a day.
*Deliverables:*
* v0,4 First accounts testing the system, PoC
success criteria: Successful transaction, no closed accounts
* v0,5 alpha - Ropsten, Ramp app
success criteria: Successful tx through Ramp, collateralized nodes
* v0,6 alpha - Anayltics, Dashboard, Suite combination on VM
success criteria: Successful suite test, new users onboarded, more transactions

*Costs:*
* core team salaries
* compensation to advisors, reviewers, testers
* travel (attend key events, meet key partners)
